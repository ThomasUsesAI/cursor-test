# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Structured Development Process
- Break each feature into logical, manageable steps
- Plan implementation before coding
- Document architectural decisions
- Use version control effectively with meaningful commits

### 2. Code Architecture
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Use Entity Component System (ECS) for game objects
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Write modular and reusable components

### 3. Game Design Focus
#### Strategic Depth
- Implement thoughtful decision-making mechanics
- Balance resource management systems
- Create adaptable gameplay scenarios
- Design meaningful player choices

#### Roguelike Elements
- Implement procedural generation for replayability
- Design permadeath mechanics with fair consequences
- Create turn-based systems that reward strategy
- Develop meaningful progression systems

#### Replayability
- Generate dynamic encounters
- Create randomized but balanced maps
- Design unlockable content that adds value
- Implement varied gameplay paths

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comprehensive docstrings to classes and functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Write unit tests for critical components

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Profile code regularly
- Optimize resource-intensive operations
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider memory management in procedural generation
- Cache frequently accessed data

### 6. Documentation Requirements
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- Document complex algorithms
- Keep README current with setup instructions
- Document game mechanics and systems
- Track technical debt and future improvements

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Implementation
1. Design the feature (document in GAME_DESIGN.md)
2. Break down into tasks
3. Implement core functionality
4. Write tests
5. Document the feature
6. Review and refactor
7. Commit with clear message

### 2. Code Review Guidelines
- Check for adherence to architecture
- Verify documentation completeness
- Ensure test coverage
- Review performance implications
- Validate game design principles

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- Playtesting for game mechanics
- Performance testing for critical systems
