# Quantum Rogue: A Strategic Time-Manipulation Roguelike

## Game Concept
Quantum Rogue is a unique strategy roguelike that combines quantum mechanics themes with tactical gameplay. Players control a quantum physicist trapped in a malfunctioning quantum research facility. Each level represents a different quantum realm where time and space behave differently.

### Core Mechanics
1. **Quantum Time Manipulation**
   - Players can create temporal echoes of their actions
   - Each turn can be "stored" and replayed in future turns
   - Limited quantum energy restricts time manipulation abilities

2. **Strategic Combat**
   - Turn-based combat system
   - Enemies follow quantum probability patterns
   - Position-based advantages and disadvantages

3. **Procedural Generation**
   - Quantum realm-themed levels
   - Dynamically generated research facilities
   - Random events and encounters based on quantum probability

4. **Progression System**
   - Unlock new quantum abilities
   - Discover and collect quantum artifacts
   - Research new technologies between runs
